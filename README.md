This directory contains code and assets for the software suite automating performance characterization. A more detailed
description of each subdirectory's contents can be read by opening the subdirectory's README file.

To run the suite, grant execute permissions to the script as follows:
`chmod u+x suite.sh`
Then run the following command on the shell:
`./suite.sh`
Note that elements of this script will require sudo permissions, for example when installing
required packages.
