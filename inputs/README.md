This directory will store the inputs that will be transferred to target devices. 

For the base inputs:
* 1_SingleObject.jpg was taken from https://www.pexels.com/photo/sea-animal-dog-zoo-23087/
* The remaining inputs were photos taken by the author

You may also insert your own inputs here. Note that the numberings should reflect your estimates on
the complexity of the images, with 1 being the least complex and higher numbers reflecting increasing
complexity.
