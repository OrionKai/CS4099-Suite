This directory will store the inputs that will be transferred to target devices. Note there is a
nested inputs directory to avoid storing the README together with the inputs, since they will be
transferred to the target device, and every file in that nested directory will be considered as an
input for the experiments' purposes.

For the base inputs:
* 1_SingleObject.jpg was taken from https://www.pexels.com/photo/sea-animal-dog-zoo-23087/
* The remaining inputs were photos taken by the author

You may also insert your own inputs here. Note that the numberings should reflect your estimates on
the complexity of the images, with 1 being the least complex and higher numbers reflecting increasing
complexity.
