This directory will store results collected from the experiments on target devices, with each
subdirectory representing a single experiment set. Each subdirectory, when analyzed, will have an
"analyzed_results" subdirectory. This in turn will contain a CSV file containing aggregated results,
and two subdirectories "comparisons" and "plots". "comparisons" will store CSV files containing the results
of comparing the deployment mechanisms for each experiment in the set, including the outcome of statistical 
tests. "plots" will contain graphs derived from the data.
